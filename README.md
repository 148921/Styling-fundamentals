## Draft for assignment structure

1. The cascade, selectors, and specificity
  * The cascade
  * Selectors and specificity

  * Normal flow vs out of flow (float, abolute/fixed positioning)
  * Understanding how the box model affects sizing of elements
3. Creating layouts
  * Layouts using floats (keep it short, mostly here for historic purposes)
  * Layouts using flexbox
  * Layouts using grid
  * Text layouts using column
  * Remember to incorporate calc function for dynamic sizing
4. Making it responsive
  * Media queries
  * Mobile first
5. Short intro to transform and transition (css animations)
  * Maybe talk about how we can use ::before/::after elements for styling and animation purposes
  * Only add animations and transitions were it adds to usability/user experience
