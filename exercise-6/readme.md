# Exercise 6 - Make it pretty/functional

Job well done! Now you are through the basics. The next task is a bonus task and it will require you to use all the basics you have learned up until now. 

:star: [Open the starting point for this assignment at codepen](https://codepen.io/taranger/pen/GeBwWL).

As you can see the starting point is a plane HTML website. I would recommend doing the following things before starting to write the CSS:
1. Identify elements that can have the equal styling and give them the same class names
2. Give the rest of the elements class names. 

Continue on with the layout. Use floats/flex as we have gone through, or if you want a new challenge take a look at using [grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) for the layout. Make sure your layout is responsive. 

Next up you can start making things pretty(er) by for example
- Give the links a proper styling, use transitions or animations when hovering
- Change font for all default html tags and make the font and font sizes work together
- Make the menu look like a menu instead of some links
- Give the header some styling
- Give the footer some styling
