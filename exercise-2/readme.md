# Exercise 2 - Sizing and the box model
This exercise will focus on the sizing and box model of CSS, which will be important knowledge to have before devling into layouts.

You will learn about:

- Normal flow vs out of flow (float, abolute/fixed positioning)
- Understanding how the box model affects sizing of elements

### Display properties
