# Exercise 2 - Sizing and the box model
This exercise will focus on the sizing and box model of CSS, which will be important knowledge to have before devling into layouts.

You will learn about:
- The display properties (inline, inline-block, block etc...)
- Normal flow vs out of flow (float, abolute/fixed positioning)
- Understanding how the box model affects sizing of elements

## Display properties
The display property plays an important role in CSS, it decides how an HTML-element will behave in relation to other elements.
For this exercise we will be taking a look at inline, inline-block, block, table, flex and grid. 
For full details of display properties check out: [Display properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display)

### inline
`display: inline` will make an element behave as an inline element (like <span>). Any height and width properties will have no effect to it. Text and icons are common uses for display: inline.

### inline-block
`display: inline-block` will make an element display as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values. Uses for inline-block can be pretty much anything that you want to not take up all available space and control the size of.

### block
The block element will take up all horizontal space in the parent container, it will allways start on a new line from previous elements and stretch to the end of what confines it

### table

### flex

### grid

## Flow
